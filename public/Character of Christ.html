    <title>Character of Jesus Christ</title>

    <h1>Who is Jesus Christ</h1>
    <p>Before we can get to the character of Jesus Christ, we first need to understand who Jesus Christ is.</p>

    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=nkjv">John 1:1</a> First, we need to understand that this is God, who existed before the creation of all things. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A3&version=Nkjv">
    John 1:3</a> notice here that it says, Everything that exists was first made for him or was made for him and through him, meaning nothing can ever exist except through our Lord Jesus Christ.
    Many confuse Jesus Christ as just a man who existed and died just like all humans, which is 20% true, but he did not only die but ressurrect from death so that he could defeat the power of sin, the power of Satan.
